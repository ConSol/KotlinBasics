# Getting Kotlin

There are several ways to play around with Kotlin.
Some do not even require a download / installation.

## Online Playground

If you only want to take a quick glance on Kotlin, you don't have to install anything.

For a sneak peek on the language, you can try the [online playground](https://try.kotlinlang.org/).

## Installation

In case the online playground got you curious, Kotlin is available for installation on all major operating systems.

The currently latest stable release is v1.2.21, which is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.2.21).
