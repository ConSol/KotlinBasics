# Kotlin On The Command Line

An easy way to get started with Kotlin is via command line.

Similar to `javac`, Kotlin provides `kotlinc` to compile Kotlin code to JVM bytecode.

## Hello world!

To get started with Kotlin, we'll write and compile the classic `Hello World!` example on the command line.
To do so, we create a new file named `HelloWorld.kt` with the following content:

```Kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  println("Hello World!")
}
```

After saving the file, we're able to compile it by issuing

`kotlinc HelloWorld.kt`

This will generate a `HelloWorldKt.class` file, which can be executed using

`kotlin HelloWorldKt`

## Fat JAR

`kotlinc HelloWorld.kt -include-runtime -d hello_world.jar`

This will create a self-contained JAR file which includes the Kotline runtime.
We can execute it like this:

`java -jar hello_world.jar`

## Exercise

* Try and see what happens if you skip the `-include-runtime` flag.
* See what has been generated by examining `HelloWorldKt.class` using `javap`
